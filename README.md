# SAT Solver LvR

Main file for running the SAT solver is satsolver.py. 

The tests included for submission are in /tests folder. The uf125-01.cnf example is taken from [this](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html) site. 

###coloring.py
The coloring_pref_1000_2000.txt example is generated by the included script coloring.py. It outputs a dimacs file of the SAT formula for k-coloring the provided graph (for this sample k=6). The graph is a [preferential attachment model] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model) generated with n=1000 and m=2000.

###Running the SAT solver
The sat solver is run via command:

```
python satsolver.py [path to input file] [path to output file] 
```
The input file is in dimacs input format and the output is in the dimacs result format.

Note that the input file must not contain lines with starting with anything other than "c", "p" or clause lines (as some dimacs files do).
